<h3>🛡️ Security</h3>

While blocklists offer significant protection against trackers, malware, and advertisements, relying solely on them is not a foolproof solution for safeguarding your digital footprint. The ever-evolving nature of online threats means that a layered approach to security is crucial. I personally highly recommend using a combination of tools and techniques to enhance your privacy and security. 

For most users leveraging [Pi-hole](https://github.com/gzachariadis/Pi-Hole), I additionally recommend:

- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gzachariadis/uBlockOrigin) - A browser extension which offers advanced ad and tracker blocking capabilities, allowing for fine-grained control over what content is allowed or blocked. It works seamlessly alongside Pi-hole to provide an extra layer of protection at the browser level and minimizes the number of requests reaching your DNS.

- [OPNSense](https://github.com/gzachariadis/OPNSense): A powerful open-source firewall and routing platform, OPNSense offers comprehensive network security features, including intrusion detection and prevention systems. Works in tandem with Pi-hole to secure your network infrastructure against a broader range of threats.

- [OpenWRT](https://github.com/gzachariadis/OpenWRT): Installing OpenWRT, a customizable open-source firmware, on compatible routers allows for greater control over your network settings. With OpenWRT, you can implement additional security measures, such as setting up a secure DNS, configuring firewall rules, and integrating with Pi-hole for network-wide ad blocking.

- [Unbound](https://github.com/gzachariadis/Unbound): A high-performance, open-source DNS resolver that improves security and privacy by handling DNS queries and providing features like DNSSEC validation.
