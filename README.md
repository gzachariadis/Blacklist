<p>An automated Python-backed repository for my Pi-hole blacklisting based on my current setup and featuring many well-known blocklists from reputable sources.Please use with caution, might include false-positives. Whitelisting will be necessary, for suggestions look at my <a href="https://codeberg.org/gzachariadis/Whitelist">Whitelist.</a></p>

🎯 Purpose

Originally, this project began as a personal endeavor to protect my own digital footprints. Having spend many hours, meticulously vetting blocklists, ensuring they met high standards for reducing the likelihood of being tracked or encountering malicious content, I came to recognize the broader need for such a resource, so I decided to share my collection with the world, making it easier for everyone to enjoy a safer and more private online experience.

Currently, this repository is a virtual backup for my configuration, vetted and upgraded over-time by an automated script.

Enjoy!
