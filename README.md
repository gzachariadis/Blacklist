</div align="justify">Originally, this project began as a personal endeavor to protect my own digital footprint; Meticulously vetting blocklists, for the purpose of reducing my trackable online presence and protecting my network from being exposed to malicious content. Having worked on it, for a few months, I decided to share my collection with the world, making it easier for everyone to enjoy a safer and more private online experience.</div>

<br>
<br>

<div>Currently, this repository acts as a virtual backup; tracking and mirroring my configuration as it's being vetted and upgraded over-time. Hope you enjoy!</div>
